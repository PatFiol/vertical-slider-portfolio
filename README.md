# Photography Portfolio

### Description

Portfolio with two vertical split sliders that run in opposite directions, matching the colors.

This project is based in a tutorial by Brad Traversy, and I was inspired to use it as a portfolio por photography.

It is meant for big screens, not responsive.


### About the project

As I come from a photography background I used photos from my old portfolio.
The idea of the display is to resemble the old slide viewer I had when I was a kid.

### Things I want to try:

* Add a triple slider
* Using just one button or adding different ones. 
* Making it responsive
