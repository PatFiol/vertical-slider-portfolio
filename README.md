# Photography Portfolio

### Description

Portfolio with two vertical split sliders that run in opposite directions.

This project is based in a tutorial by Brad Traversy, and I was inspired to use it as a portfolio por photography.
But I want to make it my own, so I will be working on it to change it and add more features.


### About the project

As I have been a photographer for the last twenty years I used my own photos.
The idea of the display is to resemble the old slide viewer I had when I was a kid.

### Things I want to try:

* Add a triple slider
* Using just one button or adding different ones.
